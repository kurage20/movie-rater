Little project I did as part of local workshop.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

How to run :

npm install
npm start
scan QR code with Expo app on phone

or just copy code from App.js to https://snack.expo.io/ and run emulator
